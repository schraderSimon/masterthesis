- Very basic error estimate - this is easy. Simply show for one vector <v|M(x)|v>=lambda(x) will be a polynomial in x, necessarily bounded.
- For a general matrix T(x), find the "special points" and see how they relate to the accuracy of the eigenvector continuation algorithm

- Regarding what I talked about with Simen, for the overlap, the following extra complications show up: 
  1. The atomic orbitals are not orthogonal - need to take that into account.
  2. We are dealing with molecular orbitals, which however ARE orthogonal. So we can, in principle, use the same thingy for orthogonal matrices.
  3. One should be able to calculate the overlap between the individual MO's from the overlap matrix (will this be a DET...?
