So, what else do I want?

1. 2D-example. Show that 25 sample geometries along a very "large" stretch are sufficient.
2. Make nicer subplots instead of these ugly-ass two plots
3. Show that considering several variables at once also works (CH4 or ethylene. Probably Ethylene is better).
4. Consider an "insecurity sampling".
5. Implement machine-learning start guess for AMP-CCSD...
